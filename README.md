# üß† Customer Behavior Analytics Platform  
**Predicting 30-Day Churn & Personalized Travel Recommendations**

---

## üìò Overview  
This repository contains the complete implementation of a **Customer Behavior Analytics System** for a travel-tech platform aiming to:  

1. **Predict user churn within 30 days** using behavioral, temporal, and contextual data.  
2. **Generate top-N personalized travel recommendations** (destinations or hotels) using review content.  
3. **Explain churn drivers and recommendation logic** with SHAP-based interpretability.  
4. **Quantify the ROI of targeted retention offers** for high-risk segments.  

The system integrates churn prediction and recommendation into a **unified ML pipeline**, enabling both **product** and **growth** teams to make data-driven retention and personalization decisions.

## üß© Problem Statement  
Travel platforms experience **high drop-offs during trip planning** and inconsistent repeat bookings. The objective was to design a scalable ML framework that can:  

- **Predict 30-day churn** probability for each active user.  
- **Recommend top-5 destinations or hotels** per user with clear ‚Äúwhy this‚Äù explanations.  
- **Classify customers into engagement tiers** (High, Medium, Low).  
- **Surface interpretable insights** for product strategy, pricing, and marketing.

## üìä Data Sources  

| Dataset | Description | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Hotel Booking Demand** | ~120K tabular booking records with fields like lead time, ADR, special requests, deposit type | Core dataset for churn modeling |
| **TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews** | Text dataset of hotel reviews and ratings | Feature enrichment and content-based recommendations |

---

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
**Objectives:** Profile users, sessions, and bookings to quantify funnel performance and churn risk.  

- Missing values handled (children ‚Üí 0, undefined country ‚Üí ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù).  
- Outlier filtering for ADR and guest count.  
- **Class Imbalance:** Churners ‚âà 30%, Retained ‚âà 70%.  
- **Top Correlated Churn Drivers:** Lead time, previous cancellations, length of stay.  
- Seasonal patterns visualized via monthly cancellation rates and booking lead times.

## üß† Feature Engineering  

**Core Features:**
- **RFM Metrics:** Recency, Frequency, Monetary (derived per user).  
- **Temporal Signals:** Arrival month, day of week, booking window buckets.  
- **Behavioral Metrics:** Engagement score (search depth + wishlist + clicks).  
- **Context Features:** Domestic vs international flag, deposit type, ADR tier.  
- **Advanced Derived Features:**
  - Booking stability = special_requests / previous_cancellations  
  - Room mismatch = assigned vs reserved room  
  - Fourier-encoded seasonality for month cycles  

All features are standardized and stored in `engineered_features_v4.csv`.

## üßÆ Modeling Approach  

### 1. **Churn Prediction**
| Model | Type | ROC-AUC | PR-AUC | F1 |
|--------|------|----------|---------|----|
| Logistic Regression | Interpretable baseline | 0.882 | 0.837 | 0.79 |
| Random Forest | Ensemble baseline | 0.926 | 0.898 | 0.82 |
| **XGBoost** | Tuned ensemble (final) | **0.955** | **0.935** | **0.84** |

**Validation:** Temporal split + 5-fold stratified CV  
**Calibration:** Isotonic calibration for churn probabilities  

### 2. **Recommendation System**
- **Type:** Content-based recommender using TF-IDF embeddings of TripAdvisor reviews  
- **Similarity Metric:** Cosine similarity between hotel text vectors  
- **Auxiliary Model:** Calibrated Linear SVM for sentiment scoring and embedding extraction  
- **Output:** Top-N (default N=5) hotel or destination recommendations per user with ‚Äúwhy this‚Äù rationale based on keyword overlap.

## üîé Explainability & Insights  

### SHAP Interpretability
- **Global importance:** Lead time, previous cancellations, special requests.  
- **Local explanations:** Per-user waterfall plots illustrating churn contribution by feature.  
- **Segment-level insights:** Clustered SHAP profiles to derive behavioral personas.

### User Personas
| Persona | Description | Churn Risk | Key Traits |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **A ‚Äì Loyal Frequent Travelers** | Repeat customers, low variance in lead time | 10% | Business focus, stable behavior |
| **B ‚Äì Occasional Planners** | Moderate frequency, predictable booking cycles | 30% | Domestic, flexible plans |
| **C ‚Äì Price-Sensitive Explorers** | New or budget users, long lead time | 75% | High cancellations, deal seekers |

## üí∞ ROI Simulation  

Modeled impact of retention offers using predicted churn probabilities.  

| Scenario | Discount | Retention Uplift | Net ROI |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| Base | 0% | 0% | ‚Çπ0 |
| Moderate Offer | 5% | 20% | **+‚Çπ46M** |
| Aggressive Offer | 10% | 10% | +‚Çπ31M |
| Heavy Offer | 20% | 5% | ‚àí‚Çπ12M |

Positive ROI observed for targeted offers (‚â§10%) focused on high-risk personas (Persona C).

## üìà Business Insights  

- **Lead Time** and **Booking Stability** are actionable churn levers.  
- **Price sensitivity** and **cancellation history** are top churn indicators.  
- **Moderate retention incentives (5‚Äì10%)** yield optimal ROI.  
- **Content-based recommendations** enhance re-engagement for churn-prone users.

2. Deploy scoring API via **FastAPI** or **Streamlit**.  
3. Integrate **drift monitoring** and retraining triggers.  
4. Develop **personalized campaign dashboard** for marketing teams.
